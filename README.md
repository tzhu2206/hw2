# This project is a website for a photography business run by an individual photographer, with examples of his work.
# The website contains six HTML pages styled with Tailwind CSS:
#    1) A home page, with four sample images linked to the other four pages
#    2) A page featuring examples of cityscape and street photography, with links to learn more about specific locations
#    3) A page featuring examples of animal and nature photography, with descriptions of each
#    4) A page listing examples, description, and pricing for paid/commissioned photography work
#    5) A page featuring some pieces of equipment that the photographer uses, linked to online storefronts where viewers can purchase them
#    6) A contact page containing a form to reach out with questions and comments

# The website has been launched via Netlify at https://elated-shirley-ba77f5.netlify.app/
